        My name is Drew Wilson. I am a front-end web developer. I am originally
        from Oklahoma and now live in St Petersburg, Florida. I am currently
        going to St Petersburg College where I am getting my Associate in Arts.
        I recently graduated from Suncoast Developer's Guild where I completed
        an intensive full stack web development program. I enjoy building web
        applications with React, Javascript, and TailwindCSS at the moment.
        Outside of writing code I enjoy going outside and being in nature. I
        love hiking and exploring new trails with my wife and dog.
